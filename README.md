## About This Repository

This repository contains my daily backend development practice, organized topic-wise.  
I'm learning core concepts like:

- Express.js routing & middleware
- MongoDB and Mongoose data modeling
- REST API development

Each folder represents a specific concept or learning session, written while following hands-on tutorials and experiments.
